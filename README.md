# Defall_Fall-Detection

Abstract : Falls are a significant concern for elderly individuals and children, often leading to severe injuries or even fatalities. This project focuses on developing a reliable and efficient fall detection system designed to promptly identify falls and alert caregivers or emergency services. The system utilizes a combination of sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes) and machine learning algorithms to accurately distinguish between falls and normal activities. By leveraging real-time data processing, the system aims to reduce response times in critical situations, thereby enhancing the safety and well-being of vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children. The proposed solution is intended to be cost-effective, easy to use, and capable of being integrated into wearable devices or home monitoring systems.
